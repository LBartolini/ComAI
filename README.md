# Focuses

Gino is put in an environment where it has to survive.

Gino is never alone, He is going to live with others AIs.

Gino's goal is not to starve or die of thirst so water and food are two of the most important things to remember.

Gino has another problem which is predators like lions or snakes.

These are 3 of the first thing he has to learn.

Everyone is able to do one of 3 things: sleep, aptrol or action (find food, find water and fight) .

The environment will tell our AIs what is happening, for example it may say to Gino that he's starving. When Gino hear that he's going to die he immediately tell other AIs that they need to find food.

How? Using his brain he will shout a word (binary number) and others will use their brain to try to understand what that word means and if they understand what Gino is asking they will do the relative action.

If for example a lion is attacking the village the ones that are awake will shout that a lion is nearby and everyone will have to defend the village attacking the lion.

Gino's going to learn using a Genetic Algoritm and a Neural Network ( one for listening and one for speaking)
